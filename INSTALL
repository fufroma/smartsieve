INSTALLING SMARTSIEVE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains notes on installing the SmartSieve sieve 
script manager.

See the README file included in this distribution for more 
general notes on the features and requirements of SmartSieve.


DOWNLOADING SMARTSIEVE

The SmartSieve project is hosted on sourceforge.net. Releases 
can be found at:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=62641

In formation on anonymous access to the CVS can be found here:

http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=62641


REQUIREMENTS

1. SmartSieve runs on a PHP enabled web server. Apache will be the 
   most common choice for this, and is currently the only web server 
   SmartSieve is known to run on. It is therefore recommended. You 
   can find apache at:

   httpd://www.apache.org

   Apache should be configured to read and honour .htaccess files 
   for the directory in which SmartSieve is installed. See the usage 
   of the AllowOverride directive in the apache documentation.

   As passwords will be passed between users and the web server, you 
   should consider securing access to the web server with something 
   like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). To do this with Apache you will 
   need to install mod_ssl (http://www.modssl.org).

2. SmartSieve requires PHP version 4.x or greater. Note that 
   versions 4.1.1 and earlier are vulnerable to a remote vulnerability 
   in the way it handles multipart/form-data. Version 4.1.2 is 
   currently known to work fine with SmartSieve, and versions 
   4.2.2 and 4.2.3 should also work ok.

   Note: php-4.2 and above install with register_globals set to 
   off by default. While future releases of SmartSieve will work 
   adequately with register_globals set to off, it currently 
   requires it to be set to 'On' (ie. in php.ini).

   The PHP magic_quotes_runtime variable must be set to 'Off'. This 
   is usually the PHP default.

   You should build PHP as an apache module (either the DSO or 
   the static builds).

   You will find PHP at:

   http://www.php.net

3. PHP must be built with IMAP support. This requires the UW c-client 
   library. You will find the c-client at:

   ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/

4. SmartSieve will only work in conjunction with a sieve enabled 
   email server. It is currently only known to work with the 
   Cyrus imap server (http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/imapd).

   You will need to configure Cyrus to run the timsieved daemon to 
   handle sieve requests. The master daemon's configuration file 
   is usually /etc/cyrus.conf. You will need to refer to the 
   cyrus-imapd documentation for this.

   Some sieve actions involve sending mail; vacation messaging and 
   mail redirection, for example. For these actions to work, Cyrus 
   imapd must be running deliver in lmtpd mode, and able to send mail 
   using sendmail or equivalent. See the cyrus-imapd documentation 
   for more on this.

5. SmartSieve requires the Crypt/HCEMD5.php PEAR library.  PEAR is 
   the PHP Extension and Application Repository, and is included in 
   all distributions of PHP since php-4.x, so will already be 
   installed if you have successfully installed php-4.x. 
   Crypt/HCEMD5.php needs to be in the PHP include_path for scripts 
   to be able to find it.


INSTALLING SMARTSIEVE

SmartSieve is a set of PHP scripts which do not require any 
compilation. You need only move the entire source tree as it comes 
in the distribution directly under a web accessible directory. The 
location of this depends on your web server's configuration. 

$ cd /yourwebroot/
$ tar -xzf somewhere/smartsieve-x.x.x.tar.gz
$ mv smartsieve-x.x.x smartsieve

You should make sure that your web server will handle requests 
for PHP scripts correctly. For Apache, the httpd.conf file should 
contain the following lines:

AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
DirectoryIndex index.php

If possible, you should also make sure your web server will honour 
.htaccess files containing Limit directives, at least for the 
SmartSieve directory. See the Apache documentation on the 
AllowOverride directive for details on doing this with Apache.

Take a look at the PHP configuration on your server. You can either 
look at your php.ini file, or create a php script under your web 
server's webroot containing the following:

<?php phpinfo(); ?>

Check that the include_path contains the location of Crypt/HCEMD5.php. 
Make sure that magic_quotes_runtime is set to 'Off', and that 
register_globals is set to 'On'.

SmartSieve uses PHP's native support for session handling. PHP will 
usually save session data in files under /tmp. Although SmartSieve 
will encrypt passwords during use, you should make sure session.save_path 
is set to a directory which only the web server can read and write to.

Edit the SmartSieve configuration files as necessary. They can be 
found under conf/. You will certainly need to add entries for each of 
the mail servers you wish to access in conf/servers.php.

You should now be able to access SmartSieve by pointing a cookie 
enabled web browser at http://yourserver/smartsieve/.
