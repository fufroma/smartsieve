required:

TODO:
	-  note about what SmartSieve is not: ie. does not parse sieve.
	-  script head date + format config setting.
	-  welcome message + config option.
	-  cross site scripting: filter form data using htmlspecialchars and/or
	   strip_tags().
	-  inner table width formatting on main.php.
	-  set stylesheet colours with RRGGBB codes.
	-  config options for other sieve rule options (forward, reject etc).
	-  improve sieve.lib:
		- function args.
		- undef $this->errstr.
		- return codes.
	-  vacation rule checkbox on main page.
	-  generic error function, to use when openSieveSession() fails.
	-  add config option as whether to return to main.php or report 
	   success on successful update of rule or vacation.
	-  add $servers->imapflags value to conf/servers.php (?).


	-  modify to handle magic_quotes_runtime = On (?)
	-  add support for sasl proxy authentication. will need to do something 
	   with imap_open() on rule.php, perhaps write function which will return 
	   list of mboxes which the proxy user has write access to.
	   note: this will allow admin access to users scripts.
	-  help info.
	-  perhaps allow access to different scripts. could have drop down list of 
	   users scripts, allowing user to view each one.
	-  sieve.lib - ssl imap connections.
		- could use fsockopen('ssl://server...
		  or do something with the sieve STARTTLS command.
	-  need to think about interface for managing existing scripts.
