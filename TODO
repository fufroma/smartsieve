SmartSieve - TODO


Known bugs

1. Bug #1775235: "Proxy user: wrong folders displayed".
2. SmartSieve does not wrap its metadata lines, so these could, in theory, exceed the
   maximum sieve line length. This is 16KB though, so even very large rules should not get 
   anywhere near this.

TODO for 1.0

* Fix mcrypt.php: MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM->MCRYPT_RAND, keep IV, and mcrypt_generic_deinit
* Fix CSS caching.
* Add configuration tool.

TODO for 2.0

* Implement rule/condition/action as objects
* Support sieve on shared mailboxes (cyrus 2.3)
* Find permanent fix for Bug #1775235: proxy authz folder list issue
* Fearure request #1657537: "Case-insensitive pattern matching".

Miscellaneous TODOs

* More htmlspecialchars()
* Handle magic_quotes_runtime = 'On'
* Make use of sieve redirect, reject, etc configurable
