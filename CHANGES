16 Nov 2005 S Grier
Changes to auth handling:
- Abstrct SmartSieve login into new SmartSieve::login() function

  of the current session, handle login attempts and redirect to the login page
  if necessary
- A few include/require calls changed to use SmartSieve::getConf()
- New initial_page config option controls which page users see following login
- Added new SmartSieve::destroy() function. Make sure we destroy the current
  session following an auth failure. This will avoid browser loops.

* Use new Managesieve class instead of SieveSession. We make the managesieve object 
  global rather than owned by the $sieve object.

16 April 2004 S Grier
* Support proxy authorization. We now authenticate as $sieve->auth, and authorize 
  as $sieve->authz. Only users authenticating as a Cyrus admin or sieve_admin will 
  be able to authorize as a different user. Also, note that the PHP imap extension 
  doesn't support proxy authz, so the mailbox listing will be wrong.

13 April 2004 S Grier
* Added Russian koi8-r translation. Contributed by Alexander Borovsky aka Partizan.
* Added $server['auth_domain'] option to append domain on usernames if 
  fully-qualified usernames are needed. (Markus Rechtien)

14 Jan 2004 S Grier
* Added scripts/locales_update.pl script. This can be used to (re)generate 
  the translation files for supported languages. It will extract all output 
  strings passed via the SmartSieve::text() function, and reuse any existing 
  translations from the old translation file.

17 Dec 2003 S Grier
* SmartSieve::Text() -> SmartSieve::text().
* cleaned up some SmartSieve::text() calls.

15 Dec 2003 S Grier
* SmartSieve::GetCharset() -> SmartSieve::getCharset().

11 Dec 2003 S Grier
* SmartSieve::Text() now takes an $args array argument, which is passed to a 
  vsprintf() call. This allows us to translate strings with variables in them.
* isset($phrase[$string]) changed to !empty($phrase[$string]) in SmartSieve::Text().
* merge changes in HEAD to i18n branch.

14 Nov 2003 S Grier
* set session.use_trans_sid off and call session_set_cookie_params() on each page.
* use AppSession::getFormValue() to get reason value in login.php. and call 
  session_destroy() on logout.

12 Nov 2003 S Grier
* call session_name() and session_start() from index.php in order to redirect
  correctly, and call AppSession::setUrl() to work with cookieless sessions.
* call SmartSieve::mutf7Decode() instead of imap_utf7_decode() in AppSession::retrieveMailboxList().

11 Nov 2003 S Grier
* don't use short_open_tags in conf/locale/*/strings.php.

03 Nov 2003 S Grier
* fixed small bug in custom rule handling. should not be deemed unconditional if action_arg starts
  with (els)if.

31 Oct 2003 S Grier
* added mutf7Decode() and modifiedToPlainUTF7() functions. We want to avoid using
  the imap_utf7_decode() to decode mailbox names because it only converts modified
  UTF-7 into ISO-8859-1. These functions convert mUTF-7 encoded mailbox names into
  whatever character encoding is needed by the current locale. The modifiedToPlainUTF7()
  code was contributed by Den aka Diesel.

29 Oct 2003 S Grier
* vacation rule changes:
 - $default->vacation_days now defaults to 7 and max_vacation_days is now 30 as per 
   draft-showalter-sieve-vacation-04.
 - new require_vacation_days and require_vacation_addresses config options. If these are set to 
   false the defaults are ignored and the user will be able to not specify these values, in which 
   case we will not then include the :days or :addresses arguments when writing the vacation rule 
   to the script. These are optional arguments in draft-showalter-sieve-vacation-04.
 - new buildVacationString() function in main.php for an improved vacation rule summary.
 - display defaults on vacation.php if no current vacation rule.

27 Oct 2003 S Grier
* moved html from rule.php, scripts.php, vacation.php and login.php to templates.

23 Oct 2003 S Grier
* added forward mail interface forward.php.

26 Sept 2003 S Grier
* added a javascript confirmation popup when a match string contains wildcard chars with 
  $default->websieve_auto_matches = true to warn them that :matches will be used.
* add $default->websieve_auto_matches config option to control the automatic use of the :matches 
  comparator where match string contains wildcard characters. This defaults to off because of 
  the unexpected results this can produce.

23 Sept 2003 S Grier
* small change to imapport comment.

19 Sept 2003 S Grier
* sieve.lib: changes to socket handling:
  - initialize $this->socket false.
  - set $this->socket false in close() function.
  - check status of socket with is_resource() calls.

12 Sept 2003 S Grier
* rule.php: set wrap="off" for custom rule textarea.

22 August 2003 S Grier

* Fixed DIGEST-MD5 for SASL v1.x.
* sieve.lib: getscript() now returns array $resp containing raw script and script size.

17 July 2003 S Grier
* set $rule['unconditional'] for custom rule if unconditional.

16 July 2003 S Grier
* add "vacation" to require line if custom rule contains vacation command.

14 July 2003 S Grier
* added support for Websieve's custom rules.

04 July 2003 S Grier
* added support for the DIGEST-MD5 sasl auth mechanism. based on Scott 
  Russell's patch for sieve-php.lib, and RFC 2831.
  Note: this is completely untested.

20 June 2003 S Grier
* sieve.lib:
  - abstracted SASL authenticate command into new _authenticate() function. 
    This is necessary for adding support for other SASL mechanisms.
  - new _selectsaslmech() function selects which of the supported SASL mechanisms 
    to use. Returns false if none of the supported mechanisms are available on 
    the server.

29 May 2003 S Grier
* set the language in the PHP session, rather than the AppSession object.
  this will make the translation work for the login page.
* include/login.js: added changeLang() function. The language on the login page
  will change as the value of the language list box is changed, unless there is
  a value in the username or password fields (so they don't get lost).
* lib/SmartSieve.lib:
  - added getLang() function. return $default->language if not set in session                                                                             
    if not set in session, GET or POST.
  - modified Text() and GetChar() to use getLang().
                                                                             
28 May 2003 S Grier
* rule.php: 2 strings for which SmartSieve::Text() should not be used.
                                                                             
23 May 2003 S Grier

* lib/Crypt/mcrypt.php:
   fixed undefined index warnings in $args array.
* can now set SmartSieveCrypt $args from config.

14 May 2003 S Grier
* can now reverse a match condition by preceding a match string with the ! 
  character, eg. "!matchstr" = 'not :contains "matchstr"'.
* now interprets * and ? as wildcard chars and implements the :matches match type.

13 May 2003 S Grier
* scripts.php:
   fixed Activate link broken in IE-6.0 (bug #732546).

12 May 2003 S Grier

   only use libmcrypt if function mcrypt_module_open exists (libmcrypt >= 2.4.x).
* now supports libmcrypt for encryption.

30 April 2003 S Grier
* login.php:
   now tries to authenticate when a SmartSieve session already exists. If this 
   fails SmartSieve now warns that its cookie settings may be wrong. This stops 
   browser loops when cookie_domain and cookie_path are set incorrectly.
* SmartSieve.lib:
   pass SieveSession object $default->socket_timeout value.

28 April 2003 S Grier
* Re-worked SmartSieve's cryptographic handling:
 - abstracted the code which interfaces with external cryptographic libraries into
   a new SmartSieveCrypt class. SmartSieveCrypt::factory() instantiates a sub-class 
   which interfaces with the chosen cryptographic library. Sub-classes can be found 
   in lib/Crypt/. Encrypt::getCryptLib() decides which library SmartSieve should use.
 - The Encrypt class now instantiates a SmartSieveCrypt object to do the encryption
   decryption work.
 - Added support for PEAR's Crypt_Rc4 library.

16 April 2003 S Grier
* sieve.lib:
 - fixed bug in read(). no longer returns $buffer if socket_get_status() 
   reports no bytes left in the read buffer, as read() may read them faster 
   than they arrive. was causing lines to be broken, and rules to be lost.

10 April 2003 S Grier
* vacation.php:
 - make $script a reference, to fix bug similar to bug #717615 in rule.php.

09 April 2003 S Grier
* rule.php:
 - fixed undefined index warnings when rule doesn't exist.
 - fixed bug where a new rule would be lost if you select 'Create New Rule' 
   from the create new rule page (bug #717615).
 - fixed problems caused by hidden ruleID value not being set correctly on 
   saving a new rule.

17 March 2003 S Grier

* login.php: include returned error in log message for failed login.
* numerous changes to lib/sieve.lib: 
  - added class var declarations.
  - renamed $capabilities as $extensions.
  - change to use fread() rather than fgets(). fread() is binary safe, and 
    is more appropriate for reading single bytes. this will make SmartSieve 
    work on php-4.3.0pre2.
  - added $socket_timeout and socket_set_timeout() call so read() will not 
    wait forever on the socket.
  - read() now calls socket_get_status() and returns if socket has timed out 
    or has no bytes left to read. this should make read() less likely to hang 
    if there's a problem.
  - now retrieves the newline char from the socket when line ends in a CRLF.

07 Nov 2002 S Grier
* rule.php: move call-time pass-by-reference checkRule(&$rule) to function
