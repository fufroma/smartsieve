* 1st bash at handling multiple scripts in same login session.
* new initialWorkingScript function. SmartSieve now selects which script to 
  open following a login. if script is passed from the login form, it will 
  open that; or if not, if a script is set as the active script on the server, 
  it open that; or if not, it will open the first of the list of user's scripts

* fixed bug in sieve.lib's activatescript: no longer need to read extra newline.

03 Jan 2003 S Grier

29 Dec 2002 S Grier
* lib/SmartSieve.lib:
  - take note of script size.
  - read and note encoded mode value. only used by Websieve.
  - check script has recognised encoding of rules. if script was not 
    previously written by SmartSieve/Websieve, $script->so will indicate 
    that is it not safe to overwrite the script.

  - warn if script was written in Websieve's advanced mode.

11 Dec 2002 S Grier

* AppSession class now always sets errstr when returning false.
* initialize SieveSession object with function arguments.
* added var declarations for AppSession and Script classes.
* keep server defaults if not set in conf/servers.php.

* login.php: include returned error in log message for failed login.
* numerous changes to lib/sieve.lib: 
  - added class var declarations.
  - renamed $capabilities as $extensions.
  - change to use fread() rather than fgets(). fread() is binary safe, and 
    is more appropriate for reading single bytes. this will make SmartSieve 
    work on php-4.3.0pre2.
  - added $socket_timeout and socket_set_timeout() call so read() will not 
    wait forever on the socket.
  - read() now calls socket_get_status() and returns if socket has timed out 
    or has no bytes left to read. this should make read() less likely to hang 
    if there's a problem.
  - now retrieves the newline char from the socket when line ends in a CRLF.
