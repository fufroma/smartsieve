SMARTSIEVE SIEVE SCRIPT MANAGER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SmartSieve-1.0

SmartSieve is a web based graphical user interface for creating and 
managing Sieve scripts on a sieve-enabled mail server. It provides a 
way for non-technical email users to generate Sieve rules for mail 
filtering and vacation messaging without prior knowledge of the 
Sieve scripting language. SmartSieve is written in PHP and is 
intended to be intuitive to use, and simple to configure.

SmartSieve will be of interest to institutions running Cyrus imapd 
or Dovecot to provide imap based mail access and who require a 
user-friendly way for users to manage mail filtering and vacation 
messaging.

SmartSieve is not a Sieve script 'parser'. It cannot directly read 
and understand the Sieve language itself. For this reason, the GUI 
will only work for Sieve scripts created by SmartSieve. Other 
non-SmartSieve scripts can be edited in SmartSieve's direct edit 
mode.


PROJECT STATUS

stable. See the requirements section of the INSTALL file for details 
of the versions of PHP and Cyrus that SmartSieve is known to work

CONTRIBUTING

Contributions to the SmartSieve project are always welcome. If you want 
to contribute in some way then the first thing you should do is subscribe 
to the smartsieve-general mailing list. Send a message to the list 
explaining what you plan to do to make sure you don't duplicate work being 
done by someone else, or that has already been added. The TODO file in the 
SmartSieve distribution contains a list of tasks to be done.

If you're contributing code make sure you are working on the most recent 
code base. Check out the latest version from the CVS. There are instructions 
on doing this at:

http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=62641

Code should be contributed in the form of a patch, preferably generated 
using GNU diff, and should be sent to the smartsieve-general mailing list.


TRANSLATING

SmartSieve includes support for internationalization (i18n). If you want 
to translate SmartSieve into another language, first check a translation 
in that language does not already exist. Translations live under 
conf/locale/[locale name], where locale name is formed from the two digit 
language code (see ISO 639) and the two digit country code (see ISO 3166), 
eg en_GB.

To create the translation, you should use the locales_update.pl script in 
the scripts directory of the SmartSieve distribution. First, create the 
directory for the locale you are creating a translation for, and then run 
the locales_update script:

$ cd smartsieve/
$ mkdir conf/locale/en_GB
$ cd scripts/
$ ./locales_update.pl en_GB

This will create a strings.php.new file containing all the strings to be 
translated. If there is an existing strings.php translations file, it will 
extract any existing translations. You will need to edit this file and 
complete all the necessary translations, and then copy the strings.php.new 
file to strings.php.

Add appropriate entries for your new locale to the conf/locales.php file. 
If your translation uses a character set other than iso-5589-1 you will 
need to specify it in this file.

Then send a copy of your translations file to the smartsieve-general list 
to share it with the rest of us! Don't forget to indicate what charset the 
translation uses.
