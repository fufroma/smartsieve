SMARTSIEVE SIEVE SCRIPT MANAGER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SmartSieve-0.3.1devel

SmartSieve is a web based graphical user interface for creating and 
managing sieve scripts on a Cyrus imap mail server. It provides a 
way for non-technical Cyrus imap users to generate sieve rules for 
mail filtering and vacation messaging without prior knowledge of the 
sieve scripting language. SmartSieve is written in PHP and is 
intended to be intuitive to use, and simple to configure.

SmartSieve will be of interest to institutions running Cyrus imapd 
to provide imap based mail access and who require a user-friendly 
way for users to manage mail filtering and vacation messaging. It 
will be of particular interest to those currently deploying Websieve 
for this purpose. SmartSieve is compatible with Websieve in that 
sieve scripts created using Websieve can be read and modified using 
SmartSieve, and visa-versa.

SmartSieve is not a sieve script 'parser'. It cannot directly read 
and understand the sieve language itself. It should, therefore, not 
be used to read sieve scripts which were not created using SmartSieve 
(although it should handle scripts created by Websieve).


PROJECT STATUS

At the time of this release SmartSieve is pre-alpha development 
software. There may well be bugs in the code, and I cannot guarantee 
that SmartSieve will work at all with your web and imap servers (see 
the requirements section of the INSTALL file for software it is 
currently known to work with). I do not accept responsibility for 
any loss or damage which might occur as a result of using this 
software.

Please feel free to give SmartSieve a whirl. At this stage I would 
appreciate any feedback you might provide. I am particularly keen to 
know what platforms and versions SmartSieve works on, and those it 
doesn't. If you try SmartSieve on a web and/or imap server not 
mentioned in the requirements section of the INSTALL file, please let 
me know the result. Do let me know of any bugs or suggestions you 
might have, or if you would like to contribute. See the support 
section for methods of providing feedback.
